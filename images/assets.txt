**NAVBAR is fine at small scale but at about 510 px width but funny until about 560px
james says rems as rems are relative to the parent, so for sections use rems, ie. for the bits in a section or a div
then the remn will keep everything locked relative to the other items in the items for scale. might have to trry and fiddle the values a little as they are bit diff to ems
also ems are better for main/larger parts
